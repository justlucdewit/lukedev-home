			Hi, my name is Luc, and ive always been curious about the world around me. Ever 
			since I've touched my first computer, I've been wanting to find out how it and 
			its applications worked.

		<br /><br />
		
		<div>
			When I was 14 years old I started learning about how to write 
			batch scripts and how to use them to create terminal based text adventure games 
			on windows. From there I ended up shifting towards web development with HTML CSS 
			and JavaScript. Later I also found out about programming outside of the browser, 
			via languages like python and C.
		</div>

		<br /><br />

		<div>
			Since then, ive been expanding my skills and knowledge in this area and became 
			really invested into the world of software development. The most important thing 
			about it is not your skills, but your joy, when you practice something that you 
			really enjoy, you automatically gain skill and expertise over time.
